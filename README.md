Protein Generation with Transformer Models
==========================================


This project explores the use of transformer-based models for protein generation. The methodology incorporates advanced techniques like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and AlphaFold for fine-tuning and validation, providing high-confidence 3D structural predictions of proteins.

Features
- Preprocessing protein sequences with tokenization and augmentation.
- Fine-tuning using LLaMA and LoRA techniques.
- Structural validation through AlphaFold with confidence metrics like pLDDT and pTMscore.
- Interactive visualization of predicted 3D structures.

Special thanks to:

- DeepMind for AlphaFold.
- Open-source contributors for LLaMA and LoRA implementations.
